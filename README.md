Raycaster
=========

This is a simple raycaster engine written in JavaScript using the HTML5 Canvas. A live demo is [here](http://quidmonkey.github.io/raycaster/).

I use [dat.gui](https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/) as my controller to manipulate the engine variables dynamically.

I use the [William Wall](http://opengameart.org/content/williamwall01) stone texture provided by [opengameart.org](http://opengameart.org/).

Thanks to [F. Permadi](http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/) and [H. Loftis](http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/) for their raycasting tutorials. It was only by taking apart their programs that I was able to create my own engine.
